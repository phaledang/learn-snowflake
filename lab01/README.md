## üè† Step 2: Exploring the Snowflake Web Interface

### 2.1 Login to Snowflake
1. Use the URL provided in your welcome email
2. Login with your credentials
3. You'll see the Snowflake web interface (SnowSight)

### 2.2 Interface Overview
**Main Navigation (Left Sidebar):**
- **Worksheets**: Where you write and execute SQL
- **Dashboards**: For data visualization
- **Data**: Browse databases, schemas, and tables
- **Marketplace**: Access shared data
- **Admin**: Account and user management

**Top Navigation:**
- Account selector (if you have multiple accounts)
- User profile and settings
- Help and documentation

### 2.3 Key Concepts
- **Account**: Your Snowflake instance
- **Warehouse**: Compute resources for queries
- **Database**: Container for schemas
- **Schema**: Container for tables and other objects
- **Role**: Security mechanism for access control

## üìä Step 3: Your First SQL Queries

### 3.1 Create a Worksheet
1. Click on "Worksheets" in the left navigation
2. Click "+ Worksheet" to create a new worksheet
3. Name your worksheet "Lab01_Getting_Started"

### 3.2 Create a Virtual Warehouse
A virtual warehouse provides the compute power for your queries.

```sql
-- Create a virtual warehouse for our labs
CREATE WAREHOUSE IF NOT EXISTS LEARN_WH
WITH WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'X-SMALL'
AUTO_SUSPEND = 60
AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
COMMENT = 'Warehouse for Snowflake learning labs';

-- Use the warehouse
USE WAREHOUSE LEARN_WH;
```

### 3.3 Create a Database and Schema
```sql
-- Create a database for our labs
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS LEARN_SNOWFLAKE
COMMENT = 'Database for Snowflake learning labs';

-- Use the database
USE DATABASE LEARN_SNOWFLAKE;

-- Create a schema
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS SANDBOX
COMMENT = 'Schema for practice and experimentation';

-- Use the schema
USE SCHEMA SANDBOX;
```

### 3.4 Create Your First Table
```sql
-- Create a simple employee table
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE employees (
    id NUMBER AUTOINCREMENT START 1 INCREMENT 1,
    name STRING,
    department STRING,
    salary NUMBER,
    hire_date DATE
);

-- Insert some sample data
INSERT INTO employees (name, department, salary, hire_date) VALUES
('John Smith', 'Engineering', 75000, '2023-01-15'),
('Jane Doe', 'Marketing', 65000, '2023-02-20'),
('Bob Johnson', 'Sales', 60000, '2023-03-10'),
('Alice Brown', 'Engineering', 80000, '2023-01-25'),
('Charlie Wilson', 'HR', 55000, '2023-04-05');
```

### 3.5 Query Your Data
```sql
-- View all employees
SELECT * FROM employees;

-- Count employees by department
SELECT department, COUNT(*) as employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY employee_count DESC;

-- Find highest paid employees
SELECT name, department, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 70000
ORDER BY salary DESC;

-- Calculate average salary by department
SELECT department, 
       AVG(salary) as avg_salary,
       MIN(salary) as min_salary,
       MAX(salary) as max_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;
```

## üîç Step 4: Exploring Snowflake Features

### 4.1 Query History
1. Click on "Activity" in the top navigation
2. Select "Query History"
3. Review all the queries you've executed
4. Notice the execution time and data scanned

### 4.2 Data Preview
1. Navigate to "Data" in the left sidebar
2. Expand your database and schema
3. Click on the "employees" table
4. Explore the table structure and sample data

### 4.3 Warehouse Monitoring
```sql
-- Check warehouse usage
SHOW WAREHOUSES;

-- View warehouse usage history
SELECT *
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY
WHERE WAREHOUSE_NAME = 'LEARN_WH'
ORDER BY START_TIME DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## üìà Step 5: Understanding Costs and Credits

### 5.1 Monitoring Credits
Snowflake provides $400 worth of free credits for your trial:
- Virtual warehouses consume credits when running
- Storage has minimal cost during trial
- Credits are consumed per second of warehouse usage

### 5.2 Best Practices for Credit Management
```sql
-- Always suspend warehouses when not in use
ALTER WAREHOUSE LEARN_WH SUSPEND;

-- Resume when needed
ALTER WAREHOUSE LEARN_WH RESUME;

-- Check current warehouse status
SHOW WAREHOUSES LIKE 'LEARN_WH';
```

## üßπ Step 6: Cleanup (Optional)

If you want to clean up the resources created in this lab:

```sql
-- Drop the table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employees;

-- Suspend the warehouse
ALTER WAREHOUSE LEARN_WH SUSPEND;

-- Note: We'll keep the database and warehouse for future labs
```

## üéâ Congratulations!

You've successfully completed Lab 01! You now have:
- A working Snowflake environment
- Basic understanding of the interface
- Experience with fundamental SQL operations
- Knowledge of warehouse and credit management

## üîú Next Steps

Ready for more? Continue with [Lab 02: Snowflake Architecture & Basic SQL](../lab02/) to deepen your understanding of Snowflake's unique architecture and advanced SQL capabilities.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Issue**: Can't access Snowflake after signup
**Solution**: Check your email (including spam folder) for the activation link

**Issue**: Queries taking too long
**Solution**: Ensure your warehouse is running: `ALTER WAREHOUSE LEARN_WH RESUME;`

**Issue**: Permission errors
**Solution**: Make sure you're using the correct role. Try: `USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;`

**Issue**: Can't see created objects
**Solution**: Verify you're in the correct context:
```sql
SELECT CURRENT_DATABASE(), CURRENT_SCHEMA(), CURRENT_WAREHOUSE();
```
